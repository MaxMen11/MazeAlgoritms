# MazeAlgorithms

The U&Walls Maze Algorithm operates as follows:

1. **Initial Setup**: Start with a square area.
2. **Dividing the Area**: Each side of the square is divided into halves, and one side is chosen randomly.
3. **Wall Selection**: Select a random inner wall from one of the four walls in a '+' pattern.
4. **Recursion**: Split the current area into four parts and repeat the process for each section.
5. **Continuity**: This recursive process continues infinitely, generating varying complexity levels of perfect mazes with four exits on each side.
